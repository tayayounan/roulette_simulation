**Description:**

Simulating and analyzing the Martingale and Doubling betting strategies in roulette using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate their profitability and risks.

**INTRODUCTION**

In this notebook, we explore two popular betting strategies—Martingale and Doubling—within the context of roulette. We simulate these strategies over a large number of rounds to evaluate their performance, focusing on key metrics such as total profit and the probability of making a profit. By conducting Monte Carlo simulations for both American and European roulette, we aim to identify which strategy, if any, offers a statistical advantage in terms of capital growth. Ultimately, this analysis will highlight the potential risks and rewards of each approach under different scenarios.
